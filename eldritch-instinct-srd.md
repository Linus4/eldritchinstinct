# Eldritch Instinct System Reference Document (v0.7)
{: .no_toc }

**Eldritch Instinct** is an [adventure game](https://questingblog.com/adventure-game-vs-osr/) for one facilitator (the **Warden**) and at least one other player.
Players act as curious investigators of the strange and unexplained. They will run from delusional cultists, hide from stalking shadows and face terrifying monstrosities. And they will change - through encounters with the unnatural forces of the Mythos and the limits of their own Humanity.

Eldritch Instinct was designed to run low-pulp scenarios and campaigns while following the axioms described by Ben Milton, Steven Lumpkin and David Perry in the Principia Apocrypha.

It is inspired by and combines mechanics from games like Mothership by Tuesday Knight Games (Critical Wounds), Cthulhu Dark by Graham Walmsley, Nemesis by Arc Dream Publishing (Notches), Cairn by Yochai Gal, Call of Cthulhu by Chaosium Inc. (Magic, Bonds), Into the Odd by Chris McDowall, Blades in the Dark by John Harper (Position and Effect) and Rats in the Walls by Kobayashi (Research).

The names and gear tables in the character creation section are based on the United States of America roughly in the middle of the 20th century. Other than that, this system is not tied to any particular place or period.

For the purposes of this game, the Mythos is a collection of stories, entities, characters and places conceived by Howard Phillips Lovecraft with contributions from his contemporary authors such as Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch. Since then, many authors, directors, artists and scenario designers have contributed their, often contradictory, ideas to the Mythos. The Warden may choose freely which elements of the Mythos to include in their game.

## Overview

**Eldritch Instinct** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

### External Interaction
Players interact with the fictional world directly through questions and descriptions instead of mechanics. Questions are gameplay.

### Roll-Play
Mechanics should create tense situations and force players to make tough choices. They are not a simulation.

### Immersion
The rules, or the absence thereof, and the principles help players immerse themselves in the fictional world and create verisimilitude where it matters.

### Fail Forward
Players roll saves to avoid complications in risky situations. Don’t think of success and failure as binary options.

### Neutrality
The Warden's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

### Assumed Competence
Player characters are generally able to find information they are looking for, or to remain undetected if they try.

### Rulings
The Warden and the players make this game their own by leaving out rules they don’t like and by adding procedures and spot-rules they want.

### Death
Characters are ordinary people faced with incomprehensible horrors. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

### Character Development
Characters are changed by encounters with the Mythos and gain new skills, contacts and knowledge through in-world efforts.

### Principles
The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Wardens

### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it and present hooks that the players can pull to uncover more information.
- Tailor your answers to the character's occupation: a doctor would pick up on different details than a police officer or a journalist.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.

### Rolls
- Is what the players describe and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen. Reward clever ideas and creative use of equipment or the environment.
- Ask for saves to introduce interesting complications in very intense situations; not to see whether an investigator is able to do something.
- Consider the margins of success or failure. Failure could mean that the situation gets much worse, or that success comes at a cost (time, resources, harm, situational disadvantage).

### Motivations
- NPCs act independently of the PCs and are guided by their own motivations.
- They remember what the characters say and do, and how they affect the world.
- NPCs and even monsters don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.

### Narrative Focus
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- What a PC can do, how long they need to do it and what risks they have to take depends largely on their occupation. Let every PC be useful in their own way.

### Questions
- Make sure to leave space for interaction between characters and allow players to inject details into the fictional world.
- Ask a lot of questions like: what is going on in your head? How does that make you feel? How do you respond? What are you doing?
- Employ Jason Cordova's [Paint The Scene](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/paint-the-scene) technique: "if there is an idea, theme, or visual motif that is particularly important for an encounter or scene, ask the players what their characters observe in the scene that reinforces that idea, theme, or motif."

### Pacing
- Know how to escalate a scenario if the PCs are taking too long to solve a situation, based on the monster's or NPCs' motivations.
- During tense situations, keep up the time pressure in real life as well. Demand quick answers during a fight or chase, or use sand timers to limit how long the players get to plan before the monster finds them.
- Jump cut between players when they are separated to keep players involved, and fade out scenes when nothing new is happening to keep the game moving.

### Expectations
- Before playing, establish shared expectations with your players. Show them these principles and use something like Patrick O'Leary’s [CATS method](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2016/supplement/2016/04/12/CATS.html) (Concept, Aim, Tone, Subject Matter).
- Prepare a strong introduction for your session in order to create the right mood, pull your players into the fictional world and serve as an example for the players.

### The Trajectory of Fear
- Your goal is not to explicitly scare your players, but to create an immersive, eerie atmosphere and to build tension.
- Summarized from Ash Law's original source, start with establishing Normality as a baseline. Next, introduce signs that something is not quite right, building up Unease. Follow up with Dread, which is the suspicion of looming danger. Terror is knowing that something terrible is about to happen, but has not been revealed yet, and is the most tense kind of fear. Lastly, Horror is the brutal revelation of the threat, and releases built-up tension.
- Slowly build up from one kind of fear to the next, and utilize small releases of tension before you reveal the final horror.

## Principles for Players

### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the Warden's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- When you want something from an NPC, consider what you are asking for, what the NPC wants, whether they respect you and whether you have something that forces their hand.
- NPCs don’t always tell the whole truth. Your Warden should give hints, but who you do and don’t trust is ultimately your decision.

### Atmosphere
- Engage with the fictional world and include details provided by the Warden in your own descriptions and questions.
- Feel free to contribute details to the scene and describe your actions in a colorful way.

### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.
- Prepare to die; combat is extremely quick and violent. Make your last moments count.

### Planning
- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.
- Keep notes to help you remember details and clues from your investigation.

### Motivation
- Investigators are confronted with life-threatening violence, mind-breaking revelations and demanding tasks.
- Conceive the reason why your character would push on despite all of this.

### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.
- Always try to riff off of your character’s occupation in the way you approach situations and describe your actions.

### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

## Character Creation

#### Name, Background & Traits

First, choose or roll a **name** for your character, then their **occupation** (see tables on p. 7), which informs their knowledge and potential skills. Note however, that PCs do not hold positions of power. To make your character a bit more interesting, think about their speciality, their area of expertise in their occupation.

Next, roll a d4 for each of your character’s **personality** factors and think of one detail about your PC’s face and clothes.

#### Ability Scores

Player Characters (PCs) have three attributes: **Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**. 

When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character’s ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

#### Hit Protection

Roll 1d6+2 to determine your PC’s starting **Hit Protection** (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat.

#### Magic Points

A PC's Magic Points (MP) start at the PC's WIL and are used to cast spells.

#### Mythos Knowledge

A PC's Mythos Knowledge (MK) starts at 0. It represents how much a character has learned about the Mythos.

#### Languages

Every character understands their own native language and one other language. Choose from current languages (like French, Italian, German etc.) and ancient languages (like Greek, Latin, Arabic, etc.).

#### Contacts

Every PC knows one person they trust and who helps them with favors such as research, translation or transport. Give them a name, two languages and an occupation.

#### Age

Decide how old your character is, or roll a d4 representing the tens digit, a d10 for the single digit and add 7.

#### Bonds

Roll on the **Bonds Table** (p. 8) to determine the four most significant things that tie your PC to this world. Use the results as a starting point and come up with something short and *specific*.

#### Inventory

Characters have a total of 9 inventory slots. Most items such as a magazine or a flashlight take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. 

Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 9 slots) is reduced to 0 HP. A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows.

As carrying bulky weapons would raise suspicion, it is generally assumed that PCs keep their bulky weapons hidden in their car or at home, unless the players say otherwise.

If you have a gun, divide the circle labeled **Magazine** into a number of sections equal to the weapon's Shots value. A loaded magazine does not count towards the inventory limit.

#### Starting Gear

All PCs begin with two items from the **Gear Table** (p. 8) and any other items as the Warden sees fit depending on the occupation and the scenario.

The PC with the lowest ability score total also starts with a source of light.

#### Backstories and Relationships

First, write a sentence about your character on the back page and pass your character sheet on to the player on your right. They add a sentence linking their character to yours and defining the relationship. Repeat this process one more time, or give your sheet to a third player so that they can expand on the first relationship.

#### Organization

When you are playing a series of short and unrelated scenarios, you might want to come up with an organization that all players belong to or that they found after their first adventure. The organization should have a way of recruiting new members, should be sworn to secrecy and strive to study and suppress the Mythos.

#### Motivation

Investigators are confronted with life-threatening violence, mind-breaking revelations and demanding tasks. During play, conceive and adapt the reason why your character would push on despite all of this. See **Motivation Inspiration Table** on p.6.

## Rules

### Abilities

Each of the three abilities are used in different circumstances.

**Strength (STR)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, climbing, restraining a person, etc.\
**Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, sneaking, balancing, etc.\
**Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves to recall training, resist manipulation of your thoughts, deceive, etc.

### Saves

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If they roll equal to or under that ability score, they pass. Otherwise, they fail.

A 1 is always a **critical success**, and a 20 is always a **critical fail**.

For an **opposed** save, both the PC and their opponent make a save. Whoever rolls the *highest* number under or equal to their ability score wins the save. If both sides fail, the *highest* result wins. Add any ability score above 20 to your result.

### Difficulty

When a PC is in a favorable or in a particularly difficult situation and must make a save, don’t use a mechanical solution to make success more or less likely. Instead, limit or increase the risks and possible effects purely in the fictional world.

### Healing

Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP.

Ability loss can usually be restored with a couple of weeks’ rest in a safe place like a hospital or at home with the help of a medical professional.

A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover HP or ability scores.

### Die of Fate

Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, looking for specific items, etc.). In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors the players. A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their allies.

### Tension Pool

This procedure is from [The Angry DM’s blog](theangrygm.com/definitive-tension-pool/) and is intended to be used during the investigation, while saves are used more for action and open confrontation.

Place a container (the Tension Pool) on the table and keep six d6 (Tension Dice) nearby. 

When an investigator does something that takes time, like observing patrolling patterns, traveling to another location, searching for something, resting to restore lost HP or picking a lock, they add a Tension Die to the Tension Pool.

If a player does something **reckless**, like breaking open a door, sneaking close to opponents or lying to someone, they roll all dice in the Tension Pool and if at least one die shows a 1, the Warden determines a complication. A complication can be completely unrelated to the current task, does not have to become immediately apparent and does not necessarily mean that the PC fails at their task. Examples: encounter, change in the environment, evil agenda advances, sign or glimpse of the horror.

If there are no dice in the Tension Pool, roll 1d6 without adding it to the Tension Pool. Some tasks even require the player to both add a Tension Die and then roll all dice in the Tension Pool.

As soon as you add the sixth Tension Die, roll all dice in the Tension Pool and determine a complication if necessary. Then remove all dice from the Tension Pool.

## Example of Play

Arlene Snow the Antiquarian and Rosalie Buck, a lookout for the mob, arrive at the Miskatonic Prehistorical Museum.

Warden: The sun has already set by the time you arrive at the museum. I’m adding a die to the Tension Pool (now at 5 out of 6 dice). The doors are not locked, and inside you find a watchman keeping an eye on the entrance hall. Rolls 2d6 to determine the NPC’s reaction. An 8! He looks at you curiously and says: *“Excuse me, the museum is currently closed. Can I help you with anything?”*

Arlene: *“Good evening, my name is Dr. Snow and I work for Miskatonic’s Indus Valley department. I’m here with my student assistant to check our catalog against the exhibits.”*

Warden: As an antiquarian you certainly look the part. And the watchman is clearly out of his depth, but satisfied with your answer.

Rosalie: Quick, let’s find the Eridu casket.

Warden: You make an educated guess, Arlene, and head to the Sumeria section. Another watchman sits slumped over his desk, and you spot the casket in its showcase in the center of the dimly lit exhibition room.

Rosalie: Does it look like the watchman is asleep?

Warden: As you approach the watchman silently, you recognize a treacherous sweet smell – chloroform.

Arlene: I pry the showcase open with my screwdriver. We should not waste any time.

Warden: Let’s roll the Tension Pool, as the showcase is probably secured with an electronic alarm system. One die shows a 1, and the 2d6 for the consequence add up to 4. That’s pretty bad. A bell in the corner of the room starts to ring and you hear footsteps coming up the stairs.

Arlene: I put the casket in my bag and run down the corridor.

Warden: Alright, let’s have a little chase then. Roll DEX against the watchman. Both fail. You give it your all, but the watchman is catching up.

Rosalie: Let’s hide in one of the rooms, wait for him to run past and then go back the other way.

Warden: Sounds like a WIL save to me. Arlene fails, but Rosalie scores a critical success. The watchman runs straight past Rosalie, but notices Arlene’s bag sticking out behind the corner just in time. I’ll roll to see what the last obstacle will be. 11 – DEX – A fallen tree. Hmm, there are a few rows of these queue line dividers between you and the exit.

Rosalie: As I have already 2 points from my crit, I will hold up the last divider for Arlene to help her escape.

Warden: Alright, but if you don’t get at least 1 point in total this round, he will get you both. Arlene fails again, but Rosalie succeeds. Arlene is struggling to jump over the dividers in her skirt, but with your help you both make it out the front door while the watchman gets tangled up in the line dividers.

Arlene: *“Thank you, Rosa! He almost got me.”* What’s in the casket?

Warden: The amulet you were hoping to find appears to have been removed. Instead, you find what is undoubtedly another one of your husband’s fingers, ripped crudely off his hand. You gain 1d4 Insight, Rosalie you gain 1.

## Mythos

### Insight

You gain Insight from seeing the Unnatural. When you do, make a WIL save to determine whether you gain the full amount of Insight, or a reduced amount in case of success. Fill in the corresponding number of notches beginning at the 1 position (1 o’clock). If you gain 5 or more Insight in one go or if you cannot fill enough Insight notches, make an **Insight Save**.

### Insight Save

When you experience something mind-shatteringly dreadful, roll 1d12. If it hits an empty Insight notch or a **Hardened** notch, you keep it together. If it hits a filled in notch or a **Broken** notch, you panic.

### Panic

You or the Warden come up with a reaction for your character based on the current situation, their bonds and their experiences. It should be disruptive, last for a few rounds (d4) and have them end up in a tough spot.

When you’ve had a chance to calm down, make a WIL save. On a success, draw a permanent box around an Insight notch starting at the 1 position going clockwise as you are **Hardened**. On a fail, cross out an Insight notch starting at the 12 position going counter-clockwise as you are **Broken** and write down a one word reminder.

### Delusions

If you’ve gained a Broken notch within the last 24 hours, you might perceive a twisted version of reality. You may attempt to see through what you believe to be delusions with a WIL save. On a success, the delusions stop. On a fail, the delusions persist and you gain a Broken notch.

### Broken

Broken notches cannot be filled when gaining Insight. If you cross out an Insight notch that is already Hardened, it temporarily counts as Broken instead. When you gain a Broken notch, describe how your character is affected and how they cope with their trauma.

### Hardened

Every three Hardened notches, you lose one of your bonds. At a reasonable point in time, narrate a small vignette describing your loss.

### Getting Better

There are a number of possibilities to remove Broken notches.

**Self-help**: When you spend time with one of your bonds, make a WIL save. On a success, remove a Broken notch. Otherwise, lose your bond. On a critical fail, lose your bond and gain a Broken notch.\
**Sanatorium**: You may commit yourself to a sanatorium. At the end of each year, make a WIL save. On a success, remove a Broken notch. If you roll a critical fail, gain a Broken notch.\
**Cover traces**: Once per scenario, if you have personally suppressed knowledge of the Mythos (e.g. burning tomes or dealing with witnesses), remove a Broken notch on a successful WIL save.\
**Conversation**: Once per scenario and within the same day of a traumatic event, one PC may address the group and appeal to a personality factor of their choice. All other PCs, who have same value in that factor as the speaker, may remove a Broken notch they got this day. Give the talk first, then reveal the factor and value.

## Mythos Knowledge

You may spend 5 Mythos Knowledge (MK) to re-roll one of your damage rolls or saves, unless it is a critical fail.

### Mythos Knowledge Save

Roll 1d100 under or equal to your MK score plus your current Insight score.

### Keeping a Journal

Once per scenario, you may turn up to 2d6 Insight into MK if you write a journal entry and get a good night’s rest. Remaining Insight is removed at the Warden’s discretion – probably at the end of a scenario.

### Tomes

You can acquire knowledge of the Mythos through the study of ancient tomes, most of which were written in *foreign languages* and often provide only a partial or inaccurate understanding of the Mythos. An **initial reading** takes a few (2d6) hours and allows the reader to get an overview of the knowledge that is contained in the tome. The reader gains Insight equal to the tome’s **Mythos Rating**.

Further **study** of the tome takes a few (2d6) days, after which you may increase your MK by the tome’s Mythos rating. You may study each tome at most 4 times. Every time, though, you must gain a Broken notch.

### Spells

Some tomes might contain instructions for casting spells, which take hours or even days to learn. 

For the **First Evocation**, the PC must make a MK save. On a fail, they must either start over and learn the spell from scratch, or they may roll again. However, if they fail the second save without starting over, the spell is cast, but all spell costs are multiplied by 1d4 and the Warden rolls on the miscast table.

Casting a spell can cost MP, WIL, and generate Insight or Broken notches. If you cast a spell, but do not have sufficient MP, subtract the remainder from your STR instead. You regenerate 1 MP per hour.

### Miscast Table

| d8 | Lesser spells | Greater spells |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Small or weak life forms wither and die. | Mind shattering visions. Gain 6 Broken notches. |
| 2 | Unbearable stench. | Your body and face contort permanently. |
| 3 | Moon and stars vanish. Or total solar eclipse. | Devastating thunderstorm and tides. |
| 4 | Gusts of wind, rumbling, strange lights in the sky. | Your eyes change as you are possessed. |
| 5 | Loud and horrible screams. | Large and deep sinkholes form. |
| 6 | Your skin rots and forms pustules. | Large area bursts into flames. |
| 7 | A Mythos creature is summoned. | A horde of Mythos creatures is summoned. |
| 8 | Foul mist spreads around you. | Something or someone dear to the caster is annihilated. |

## Investigation

### Social

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose **reaction** to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

| 2 | 3-5 | 6-8 | 9-11 | 12 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

When the PCs try to get a favor or information from an NPC, consider the following factors:

**Stakes**: do the PCs ask for a lot or just a small favor?\
**Motivation**: does the PC's proposition align with what the NPC wants?\
**Respect**: does the NPC personally respect the PCs based on their behavior and reputation?\
**Leverage**: do the PCs present anything that forces the NPC's hand?

Most social encounters can be resolved by critical thinking. Sometimes, however, the NPC's reaction is unclear. In this case, the Warden makes another reaction roll and applies a modifier between -4 and +4 to the result, based on the four factors. The NPC agrees if the result is 'kind' or 'helpful' (9+). If the result is 'curious' (6-8), the NPC can still be convinced considering the four factors, but if the result is 'wary' (3-5), it takes a lot more for the NPC to agree.

### Research

A PC can do research by talking to strangers in bars, studying books in a library or scouring through records in an archive. First, they need to state a question they want answered, or a topic they want to explore. Secondly, they require access to the information and must be able to understand the language. When these conditions are met, the PC only needs time in order to get answers, which is represented by adding a Tension Die to the Tension Pool. The Warden may award only partial information after a certain amount of time and allow the players to spend more time researching. In any case, the Warden should let the players know whether they have learned everything from their source.

### Exploration

Consider three [kinds of information](https://diyanddragons.blogspot.com/2019/10/landmark-hidden-secret.html) (by Anne on diyanddragons.blogspot.com):

**Landmark** information is everything that is immediately visible when you enter a room. The Warden gives this kind of information to the players for *free*.\
**Hidden** information can only be learned if players specifically ask for it and directly interact with the fiction. It often comes at a cost: first, you probably have to spend some *time* to examine the object. Looking in the right place yields immediate results, but a general search of a room takes about 15 minutes. Second, you expose your PC to *risk* as you have to be close enough to touch the object you want to investigate.\
**Secret** information always comes at a cost and there is a *chance for failure*. In general, information should almost *never* be secret. If players interact with the fictional world, they will get answers.

Finding clues should not present a challenge to players, and there are no mechanics for exploration in Eldritch Instinct. Rather, it is a conversation between the players and the Warden: when describing a location, the Warden begins by setting the mood and presenting landmark information, which often functions as threads, that the players can pull for more information. The players may then ask questions and describe their PC’s actions in order to uncover hidden information. The Warden answers truthfully, but should make sure that characters receive information that is appropriate to their occupation. The Warden should encourage the players to state what they want to know and what their characters do to figure it out.

## Action

### Combat

#### Rounds

The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when something occurs. A round is roughly ten seconds of in-game time.

#### Actions

In one round, a character may move somewhere close (15 m) and take up to one action. This may be checking someone's vitals, attacking, reloading a gun, making a second move, dragging someone to the ground or some other reasonable action.

Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the Warden calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs.

#### Round Order

The Warden telegraphs the most likely actions taken by NPCs or monsters. Players act before their opponents. If there is a chance that the PCs are surprised at the start of combat, they have to make a DEX save in order to act in the first round.

#### Attacking & Damage

The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target’s armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s HP. Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

#### Multiple Attackers

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

#### Attack Modifiers

If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is **impaired** and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage regardless of the damage die used during the attack.

If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is **enhanced**, allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.

#### Dual Weapons

If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result. This is denoted as dX + dX.

#### Blast

Attacks with the blast quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite.

#### Critical Damage

Damage that reduces a target’s HP below zero decreases a target’s STR by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid critical damage. Additionally, some enemies have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.

A PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If left untreated, they die within the hour. If given aid and rest, they will probably stabilize: roll 1d100 on the Wounds Table.

#### Ability Score Loss

If a PC’s STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious.

Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.

#### Unconsciousness & Death

When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of an NPC. They join the party not long after in order to reduce downtime.

#### Detachments

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single detachment. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are impaired (excluding blast damage). Attacks against individuals by detachments are enhanced and deal blast damage.

#### Retreat

Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Wounds Table

| d100 | Effect | d10 | Area |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 00 | **Scarred.** You were lucky this time. | 0 | Legs |
| 10 |  | 1 | Arms |
| 20 |  | 2 | Hands |
| 30 |  | 3 | Shoulders |
| 40 |  | 4 | Waist |
| 50 |  | 5 | Back |
| 60 | **Injured.** Effect to be determined by the Warden and the players. Lasts until you receive professional medical treatment. | 6 | Stomach |
| 70 |  | 7 | Chest |
| 80 |  | 8 | Neck |
| 90 | **Dying.** Lose 1d4 STR every 30 minutes until you receive professional medical treatment. | 9 | Head |

### Chases

During a chase, the PCs have to overcome *three* critical obstacles which require an *opposed* save each. Rolling a critical fail yields -1 point, a fail yields 0 points, a success yields 1 point and a critical success yields 2 points. A PC needs 1 point at the end of the chase in order to escape or catch their opponent.

#### Helping others

If a PC has 2 or more points at the start of the third obstacle, they may help a slow PC. The result of their third save is added to the points of the slow PC. If the slow PC does not have at least 1 point at the end, both PCs are caught.

### Chase Obstacles

The obstacles that must be overcome should be what is in the path each fugitive chooses in the fictional world. Alternatively, the Warden may put one or two obstacles in the players’ way. Whether fugitives and pursuers roll using the same ability scores depends on the situation. This allows the players to split up and choose their own path, while giving the Warden opportunities to throw a spanner in the works. You can use the following table for inspiration.

| d20 | STR | d20 | DEX | d20 | WIL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Something is in the way (crates, furniture). | 8 | Get past something in time. | 15 | Find a place to hide. |
| 2 | You are being slowed down (thicket, people). | 9 | Get down a slope. | 16 | A deep puddle. |
| 3 | Climb a wall. | 10 | Run across open field. | 17 | Cross a busy road. |
| 4 | Jump across a gap. | 11 | A fallen tree. | 18 | Fog or darkness. |
| 5 | Climb stairs or ladder. | 12 | Sharp turn. | 19 | Find a shortcut. |
| 6 | Get over or through a fence. | 13 | Uneven ground (roots, stones). | 20 | Slippery ground (mud, ice, oil). |
| 7 | Cross a stream. | 14 | Someone drops something on the ground. | | |

#### Longer Chases
If you want to draw out the chase, do five rounds total and require PCs to score at least two points in order to escape. In order to help others, a PC must have at least 3 points at the start of the fifth obstacle.

#### Vehicles

Similar to characters, vehicles have HP and Armor, but use a different set of ability scores: Engine represents the vehicle’s acceleration and top speed, Handling indicates how easy it is to navigate the vehicle around obstacles, and the Mayhem score shows how hard it is to force it off the road or how easily it can crash through obstacles. Crashing into a vehicle reduces its Mayhem score, but PCs may also go after Engine and Handling with targeted attacks. A vehicle is disabled when it takes Critical Damage, and is destroyed when its Mayhem score is reduced to 0.

**Ford Model T:** 7 Engine, 8 Handling, 10 Mayhem, 5 HP, 3 Armor\
**Motorcycle:** 14 Engine, 13 Handling, 5 Mayhem, 3 HP

*Note: Please use this procedure as a starting point and expand or simplify as you see fit. Just do regular saves instead of opposed saves to keep it simple. Or allow players to perform actions between chase rounds, apply penalties such as attribute loss upon (critically) failed saves, or go completely freeform.*

### Stealth & Deception

In Eldritch Instinct, players get ahead by using their environment, the fictional world or their gear to their advantage. They find creative solutions to obstacles, using critical thinking and making difficult decisions. Furthermore, assume that investigators are fundamentally capable of disguising themselves and remaining hidden as long as they are acting on their own. Allow the players to get in over their heads, then put the screws on them.

Stealth and deception is a complex area of play: what is the player trying to do? Does their character have occupational training that would help? How does the environment look like? Are the opponents on alert? Here are a few tools and illustrative situations to help you run thrilling infiltrations, heists and escapes.

Simple situations can usually be resolved with the Tension Pool, with a save or just within the fiction. For more complex situations, on the other hand, you should zoom in and draw out the decision whether a PC is detected or remains hidden. 

Two concepts you should always have in mind when adjudicating actions in hazardous situations are risk and effect (see **Difficulty** on page 9). When the PC has everything under control and the stakes are low, they may be able to back out of their attempt on a fail or deal with a minor complication in order to remain undetected.

Usually though, a PC should already be much more committed and face greater risks when you ask for a roll as they must deal with an unexpected obstacle. Failure in such a situation does not necessarily mean that the PC is detected outright, but they might find themselves in a seriously desperate position.

Again: allow the players to get in over their heads, then put the screws on them. How long are the investigators able to remain hidden before a fight breaks out or they have to run away? Players should feel vulnerable, it should be a pressure cooker, but they should also expect to be able to get reasonably far with a stealthy or deceptive approach.

#### Illustrative Situations

1. The investigators move through a forest as they notice a cultist patrol that is looking for them. The players decide to hide behind the trees and stay quiet. The PCs are in a great position, as the environment offers places to hide in, the players noticed the cultists early and the cultists are not aware of the investigators’ presence. Every player makes a roll, and on a 20, that player is detected or there is a major compromise. (**Don’t roll a 20!**)
2. The investigators must get through a cultist checkpoint to leave the village before they are caught and used as human sacrifice. Just going through the checkpoint hoping for the best would be extremely risky as the cultists would surely recognize strangers. The best case outcome is that shortly after passing the checkpoint, a couple of cultists become aware of them and order them to halt. In order to improve their odds, they could go looking for drying clothes in the neighborhood to disguise themselves, adding a die to the Tension Pool and possibly dealing with other minor obstacles along the way. (**Multi-stage plan**)
3. The investigator carrying an ancient artifact is being pursued by an unnatural creature and has just turned the corner into another room. The Warden could offer a number of choices: leave the artifact behind and escape safely; hide in the wardrobe with an 80 % probability, but on a fail the creature is right in front of you; or hide behind the door with a 40 % probability, but on a fail the creature is almost out of the other door before it notices you. (**Offer decisions**)
4. The investigator is scouting out a cult compound on the outskirts of town, but regular patrols make it difficult to gather more valuable intel. They decide to sneak in and peek through the windows. Rolling the dice in the Tension Pool, they get a 1 and as a complication, an approaching patrol forces them deeper into the compound on their own. (**Raise the stakes**)

## Downtime

In the background or between scenarios, players can do a number of things that are summarized at the table. They can read tomes to increase their Mythos Knowledge or learn spells, spend time with their bonds or form new ones to remove Broken notches, improve an aspect of their character, craft something, research a topic, travel somewhere, make new acquaintances, or earn money.

This can translate into gaining HP or ability score, upgrading inventory space or damage with a particular weapon, but also learning cool skills, gaining the ability to handle specific situations with ease or promoting a contact so that they can be more helpful.

These are just some suggestions, and the Warden should determine the effects and the amount of time that must be spent. A good rule of thumb for the length of a downtime action is two weeks, or simply allow two downtime actions between scenarios.

It is always a good idea to build on events of the previous scenario or on notable successes and failures of the characters.

## Bestiary

**Cultist**\
4 HP, 8 STR, 10 DEX, 13 WIL, Dagger (d6)
- Some could know spells.
- Fanatics willing to give their life for their master.

**Deep One Youngling**\
3 HP, 1 Armor, 5 STR, 11 DEX, 4 WIL, bite (d6)
- Usually appear in groups (treat as detachment).
- Can shoot a poisonous stinger that deals d8 damage to DEX for one hour.

**Mi-Go Warrior**\
14 HP, 2 Armor, 14 STR, 7 DEX, 8 WIL, claws (d8 + d8)
- Can fly and call to summon additional Mi-Go.

**Shoggoth**\
25 HP, 18 STR, 5 DEX, 5 WIL, tentacles (d8, blast), detachment
- Critical damage: grapples investigator, deals d4 damage per round until freed.

### Creating Monsters and NPCs

Use the following template to model any more sophisticated Monster or NPC:

**Name**\
X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Weapon (dX)
- Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor
- Quirk, tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique
- Special effect or critical damage consequence

#### General Principles

Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary. Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardy ones 6 HP, and serious threats get 10+ HP. Use flavor and style to help them stand out.

Use critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC. Remember that HP is Hit Protection, not Hit Points. It’s a measure of resilience, luck, and gumption - not health.

### Creating Tomes

Use the following template to model a tome:

**Name**\
Language, Mythos Rating
- Appearance and condition
- Summary of its content
- Suggestion for spells

**Book of Eibon**\
Old English, Mythos Rating 8
- Ancient, falling apart, only few chapters legible.
- Accounts of the wizard Eibon from Hyperborea.

### Creating Spells

Use the following template to model a spell:

**Name**\
X MP, X WIL, dX Insight, X Broken notches, (opposed), X Casting Time
- Engaging descriptor of effects

# Rules Summary

### Saves

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If they roll equal to or under that ability score, they pass. Otherwise, they fail.

A 1 is always a critical success, and a 20 is always a critical fail.

For an **opposed** save, both the PC and their opponent make a save. Whoever rolls the *highest* number under or equal to their ability score wins the save. If both sides fail, the *highest* result wins. Add any ability score above 20 to your result.

### Actions

On their turn, a character may move up to 15 m and take up to one action. Actions may include attacking, making a second move, or other reasonable activities.

**Retreating** from a dangerous situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Inventory

PCs have 9 inventory slots: Most items take up a one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.

Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 9 slots) is reduced to 0 HP. PCs cannot carry more than their inventory allows.

### Healing

Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP (adding a die to the Tension Pool).

Ability loss can usually be restored with a couple of weeks’ rest in a safe place like a hospital or at home with the help of a medical professional.

A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover HP or ability scores.

### Round Order

The Warden telegraphs the most likely actions taken by NPCs or monsters. Players act before their opponents. If there is a chance that the PCs are surprised at the start of combat, they have to make a DEX save in order to act in the first round.

### Combat

The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target’s armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s HP. Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

If **multiple attackers** target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

If the attack is **impaired**, the attacker must roll 1d4 damage regardless of weapon. If the attack is **enhanced**,  the attacker rolls 1d12 damage instead of their normal die. Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all area targets, rolling separately for each.

### Damage

Damage that reduces a target’s HP below 0 decreases their STR by the remainder. They must then make a STR save to avoid critical damage. Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated. To check the vitals of a downed investigator, roll 1d100 on the Wounds Table.

### Insight Save

When you experience something mind-shatteringly dreadful, roll 1d12. If it hits an empty Insight notch or a Hardened notch, you keep it together. If it hits a filled in notch or a Broken notch, you panic.

### Panic

You or the Warden come up with a reaction for your character. It should be disruptive, last for a few rounds (d4) and have them end up in a tough spot.
When you’ve had a chance to calm down, make a WIL save. On a success, draw a permanent box around an Insight notch starting at the 1 position going clockwise as you are **Hardened**. On a fail, cross out an Insight notch starting at the 12 position going counter-clockwise as you are **Broken** and write down a one word reminder.

### Getting Better

There are a number of possibilities to remove Broken notches: Self-help, commitment to a sanatorium, covering traces and conversation with other PCs. Each time you get rid of one Broken notch, increase your WIL by 1d10.
