**Eldritch Instinct** is an [adventure game](https://questingblog.com/adventure-game-vs-osr/) for one facilitator (the **Warden**) and at least one other player.
Players act as curious investigators of the strange and unexplained. They will run from delusional cultists, hide from stalking shadows and face terrifying monstrosities. And they will change - through encounters with the unnatural forces of the Mythos and the limits of their own Humanity.

Eldritch Instinct was designed to run scenarios and campaigns using streamlined rules while following the axioms of the old school style as described by Ben Milton, Steven Lumpkin and David Perry in the Principia Apocrypha. It is inspired by games like Mothership by Tuesday Knight Games, Cthulhu Dark by Graham Walmsley, Nemesis by Arc Dream Publishing, Cairn by Yochai Gal, Call of Cthulhu by Chaosium Inc., Into the Odd by Chris McDowall, Blades in the Dark by John Harper and Rats in the Walls by Kobayashi.

The names and equipment tables in the character creation section are based on the United States of America roughly in the middle of the 20th century. Other than that, this system is not tied to any particular place or period.

For the purposes of this game, the Mythos is a collection of stories, entities, characters and places conceived by Howard Phillips Lovecraft with contributions from his contemporary authors such as Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch. Since then, many authors, directors, artists and scenario designers have contributed their, often contradictory, ideas to the Mythos. The Warden may choose freely which elements of the Mythos to include in their game.

## Overview

**Eldritch Instinct** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

### External Interaction
Players interact with the fictional world directly through questions and descriptions, instead of mechanics. Questions are gameplay.

### Roll-Play
Mechanics should create tense situations and force players to make tough choices. They are not a simulation.

### Immersion
The rules, or the absence thereof, and the principles help players immerse themselves in the fictional world and create verisimilitude where it matters.

### Fail Forward
Players roll saves to avoid negative consequences when performing an action. Don’t think of success and failure as binary options.

### Neutrality
The Warden's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

### Death
Characters are ordinary people faced with incomprehensible horrors. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

### Character Development
Characters are changed by encounters with the Mythos and gain new skills, contacts and knowledge through in-world efforts.

### Principles
The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Wardens

### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it and present hooks that the players can pull to uncover more information.
- Tailor your answers to the character's occupation: a doctor would pick up on different details than a police officer or a journalist.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.

### Rolls
- Is what the players describe and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Reward clever ideas and creative use of equipment or the environment. 
- Only ask for saves in very intense situations when the characters act under pressure.
- Consider the margins of success or failure. Failure could mean that the situation gets much worse, or that success comes at a cost (time, resources, harm, situational disadvantage).

### Motivations
- NPCs act independently of the PCs and are guided by their own motivations.
- They remember what the characters say and do, and how they affect the world.
- NPCs and even monsters don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.

### Narrative Focus
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you; there is no obligation to use the combat rules or other procedures in every situation.

### Questions
- Make sure that there is room for roleplay between characters and allow players to inject details into the fictional world.
- Ask a lot of questions like: what is going on in your head? How does that make you feel? How do you respond? What are you doing?
- Employ Jason Cordova's [Paint The Scene](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/paint-the-scene) technique: "if there is an idea, theme, or visual motif that is particularly important for an encounter or scene, ask the players what their characters observe in the scene that reinforces that idea, theme, or motif."

### Pacing
- Know how to escalate a scenario if the PCs are taking too long to solve a situation, based on the monster's or NPCs' motivations.
- During tense situations, keep up the time pressure in real life as well. Demand quick answers during a fight or chase, or use sand timers to limit how long the players get to plan before the monster finds them.
- Jump cut between players when they are separated to keep players involved, and fade out scenes when nothing new is happening to keep the game moving.

### Expectations
- Before playing, establish shared expectations with your players. Show them these principles and use something like Patrick O'Leary’s [CATS method](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2016/supplement/2016/04/12/CATS.html) (Concept, Aim, Tone, Subject Matter).
- Prepare a strong introduction for your session in order to create the right mood, pull your players into the fictional world and serve as an example for the players.

### The Trajectory of Fear
- Your goal is not to explicitly scare your players, but to create an immersive, eerie atmosphere and to build tension.
- Summarized from Ash Law's original source, start with establishing Normality as a baseline. Next, introduce signs that something is not quite right, building up Unease. Follow up with Dread, which is the suspicion of looming danger. Terror is knowing that something terrible is about to happen, but has not been revealed yet, and is the most tense kind of fear. Lastly, Horror is the brutal revelation of the threat, and releases built-up tension.
- Slowly build up from one kind of fear to the next, and utilize small releases of tension before you reveal the final horror.

## Principles for Players

### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the Warden's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- When you want something from an NPC, consider what you are asking for, what the NPC wants, whether they respect you and whether you have something that forces their hand.

### Atmosphere
- Engage with the fictional world and include details provided by the Warden in your own descriptions and questions.
- Feel free to contribute details to the scene and describe your actions in a colorful way.

### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.
- Prepare to die; combat is extremely quick and violent. Make your last moments count.

### Planning
- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.
- Keep notes to help you remember details and clues from your investigation.

### Motivation
- Characters are confronted with life-threatening violence, mind-breaking revelations and demanding tasks.
- Conceive the reason why your character would push on despite all of this.

### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

## Character Creation

#### Name, Background & Traits

First, choose or roll a **name** for your character, then their **occupation**, which informs their knowledge and potential skills. Note however, that PCs do not hold positions of power.

Next, roll for your character's **personality** (five factors) and think of one detail about your PC's face and clothes, each.

#### Ability Scores

Player Characters (PCs) have three attributes:
**Strength (STR)**, **Speed (SPE)**, and **Intellect (INT)**. When creating a PC, the player should roll 2d10+25 for each of their character's ability scores.

#### Resistances

PCs have three resistances:
**Willpower (WIL)**, **Constitution (CON)** and **Luck**. When creating a PC, the player should roll 2d20+30 for each of their character's resistances.

The player may then distribute 20 additional points among their PC's ability scores and resistances.

#### Hit Protection

Divide your PC's CON by 4 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection** (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing**).

If an attack takes a PC's HP below half of the maximum, the PC is **wounded** and must roll on the [wounds table](#wounds-table), fall **prone** and make a CON save or fall **unconscious**. If you lose more than you maximum HP in one blow, you die immediately. If you have 0 HP, fall unconscious and make a **Death Save**.

**Prone**: SPE saves are rolled with [-]. It takes one action or movement to stand back up.\
**Unconscious**: Character wakes up in 2d10 minutes.

#### Sanity

You Sanity (SAN) starts at 4. It is the mental construct that protects your mind from the awful reality of the Mythos.

#### Magic Points

A PC's Magic Points (MP) also start at the PC's WIL divided by 5 and are used to cast spells.

#### Mythos Knowledge

A PC's Mythos Knowledge (MK) starts at 0. It represents how much a character has learned about the Mythos.

#### Inventory

Characters have a total of 7 inventory slots. Most items such as a magazine or a flashlight take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together.

**Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 7 slots) takes twice the amount of damage and makes SPE saves with [-]. A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows.

As carrying bulky weapons would raise suspicion, it is generally assumed that PCs keep their bulky weapons hidden in their car or at home, unless the players say otherwise.

If you have a gun, divide the circle labeled **Magazine** into a number of sections equal to the weapon's Shots value. A loaded magazine does not count towards the inventory limit.

#### Starting Gear

All PCs begin with:

- Two items from the **Equipment Table**.
- One item from the **Bonus Items Table**.

#### Contacts

Every PC knows one person they trust and who will help them with favors such as research, translation or transport. Give them a name and an occupation.

## Rules

### Abilities & Resistances

Each of the six **abilities** and **resistances** are used in different circumstances.

**Strength (STR**): Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, climbing, restraining a person, etc.

**Speed (SPE):** Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, navigating, sneaking, balancing, etc.

**Intellect (INT)**: Used for saves to solve a problem, recall training, rely on experience, etc.

**Willpower (WIL)**: Used to resist horrors and manipulation of your thoughts.

**Constitution (CON)**: Used to resist injury and to determine the rate at which you heal.

**Luck**: Used to resist misfortune, and to determine if you notice little details and warning signs.

As a PC's WIL or CON change, adjust their HP, MP and Fortitude according to the rules in character creation.

### Saves

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll 1d100 for an appropriate ability score or resistance. If they roll *equal to or under that ability score*, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. 91-99 is always a failure.

When a PC does something related to their occupation, they may add 20 points to their ability score for that save.

When a player rolls doubles (e.g. 00, 44) on a save, they have rolled a **Critical** success or failure, respectively.

When the rules specify that a roll should be made with **advantage** (short form: [+]), roll twice and take the better result. Conversely, if they call for a roll with **disadvantage** (short form: [-]), roll twice and take the worse result.

### Luck

You may spend 5 Luck to re-roll an ability or resistance save, except when the result was a critical fail. After each session, make a Luck save and restaore 1d10 Luck if you fail, but you cannot have more than 90 Luck.

### Armor

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. PCs can buy Protective Clothing which provides 1 point of armor, but occupies one inventory slot and is destroyed when the PC is wounded.

### Death Save

When you have 0 HP, roll 1d10 without looking at the result. As soon as someone spends a round to check your vitals, reveal the die and look up the result on the Death Table.

**Dying**: If you do not receive professional medical treatment within 1 hour, you must make a CON save. If you fail, make another death save.

Professional medical treatment requires at least one 1 hour, a doctor and proper clinical instruments. Heals 1 HP and removes the Dying condition.

#### Death Table

| d10 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | You are **unconscious** for 2d10 minutes. Reduce your CON by 1d10. |
| 1-6 | You are **unconscious** and **dying**. Unless you receive First Aid, you will die in 1d4 rounds. |
| 7-9 | **You have died.** Create a new PC or take over a contact or NPC. |

### Healing

If you are *not* wounded, resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP.

However, if you are wounded, make a CON save after every week. On a success, recover 1d4 HP. You heal your wound on a critical success, or when you recover to more than half of your maximum HP. Every week in hospital gives [+] to your weekly CON save.

#### First Aid

A PC can make an appropriate save to tend to someone's wound. When you attempt to treat yourself, roll with [-]. On a success, stop *bleeding* and save a character with a *lethal injury* from rolling a death save. Takes 1 round and can be attempted again *once* in the following round.

**Lethal Injury**: Receive first aid within 1d10 rounds or make a death save.

### Wounds Table

| d100 | Effect | d10 | Area |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 00 | Flesh Wound. | 0 | Legs |
| 10 | Knocked back hard. | 1 | Arms |
| 20 | [-] on next save. | 2 | Hands |
| 30 | [-] on saves of one ability or resistance until First Aid. | 3 | Shoulders |
| 40 | Bleeding or Burning. | 4 | Waist |
| 50 | -1d10 on one ability or resistance. | 5 | Back |
| 60 | [-] on saves of one ability or resistance until cured. | 6 | Stomach |
| 70 | Lethal Injury. | 7 | Chest |
| 80 | Lethal Injury and Bleeding or Burning. | 8 | Neck |
| 90 | Death save. | 9 | Head |

**Bleeding**: You lose 1 HP per turn until First Aid is applied.\
**Burning**: You lose 1 HP per turn until the fire is put out.

## Mythos

### Sanity Save

When you witnesses something wholly unnatural and awful, roll 1d4. If the result is lower than your Sanity, you are unsettled and reduce your Sanity by 1. When your Sanity hits 1, make a Fortitude save and set your Sanity back to 2.

After 8 hours of uninterrupted rest, reset your Sanity to 4.

### Fortitude Save

When you experience something mind-shatteringly dreadful or when your Sanity hits 1, make a WIL save. On a success, fill in a Hardened notch. Otherwise, fill in a Broken notch, lose 1d10 WIL and panic. If you are in mortal danger, that means that you must either **fight** until the stimulus is destroyed, **flee** until you are far away or **freeze** (hide from the it).

#### Notches

**Hardened**: for every three Hardened notches you lose one of your bonds. You cannot have more Mythos knowledge than 10 times your number of Hardened notches.\
**Broken**: for every three Broken notches you develop one undesirable condition. You might feel compelled to do something or behave in a certain way, fear something, develop an unhealthy coping mechanism or suffer from delusions. When you lose the third notch, the condition improves, but kicks back in when you get back to the third notch. You and Warden may also corrupt the PC’s personality and bonds, excluding the PC’s key connection.

### Getting Better

There are a number of possibilities to remove Broken notches. Every time you successfully get rid of one Broken notch, increase your WIL by 1d10.

**Self-help**: When a PC spends time with one of their bonds, make a WIL save. On a success, remove a Broken notch. Otherwise, revise their bond, and you can no longer use it for self-help. If they spend time with their key connection, roll with [+], but on a fail, this bond is no longer their key connection. If a PC successfully uses self-help, but does not have a key connection, make this bond their new key connection.\
**Sanatorium**: A PC may commit themselves to a sanatorium for one month. On a successful WIL save, remove a Broken notch. If you roll a Critical Fail, make a Fortitude save.\
**Cover traces**: Once per session, if a PC suppresses knowledge of the Mythos (e.g. burning tomes or dealing with witnesses), make a WIL save. On a success, remove a Broken notch. Severe trauma might require more drastic measures.\
**Conversation**: Once per day and within the same day of a traumatic event, one PC may address the group and appeal to a personality factor of their choice. All other PCs, who have same value in that factor as the speaker, may remove a Broken notch they got this day. Give the talk first, then reveal the factor and value.

[back to index](#index)
<p></p>

### Mythos Knowledge

Players may try to roll under their PC’s Mythos Knowledge to see if their character knows *anything* about a creature, artifact, organization or something else Mythos-related. A PC cannot have more Mythos knowledge than 10 times their number of Hardened notches.

### Tomes

PCs can acquire knowledge of the Mythos through the study of ancient tomes, most of which were written in *foreign languages* and often provide only a partial or inaccurate understanding of the Mythos. An **initial reading** takes 2d6 hours and allows the reader to get an overview of the knowledge that is contained in the tome. The reader must make a Fortitude save and may then increase their Mythos knowledge by half of the tome's **Mythos Rating**.

Further **study** of the tome takes 2d6 days, and after another Fortitude save, the PC increases their Mythos knowledge by the tome's full Mythos rating. A PC may study each tome at most 4 times.

### Spells

Some tomes might contain instructions for casting spells, which take 2d6 days to learn. 

For the **First Evocation**, the PC must make a Mythos knowledge save. On a fail, they must either start over and learn the spell from scratch, or they may try again. However, if they fail the second save without starting over, all spell costs are multiplied by 1d6 and the Warden rolls on the miscast table.

Casting a spell can cost MP, WIL or require a Sanity or Fortitude save. If you cast a spell, but do not have sufficient MP, subtract the remainder from your HP instead. You regenerate 1 MP per hour.

Some spells require you to win an **opposed** WIL save against your target. Whoever rolls the *highest* number under or equal to their WIL wins the save. If both sides fail, the *lowest* result wins. Add any WIL above 100 to your result.

If you successfully cast a spell that was opposed by someone's WIL, increase your WIL by 1d6.

### Miscast Table

| d8 | Lesser spells | Greater spells |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Small or weak life forms wither and die. | Mind shattering visions. Gain 6 Broken notches. |
| 2 | Unbearable stench. | Your body and face contort permanently. |
| 3 | Moon and stars vanish. Or total solar eclipse. | Devastating thunderstorm and tides. |
| 4 | Gusts of wind, rumbling, strange lights in the sky. | Your eyes change as you are possessed. |
| 5 | Loud and horrible screams. | Large and deep sinkholes form. |
| 6 | Your skin rots and forms pustules. | Large area bursts into flames. |
| 7 | A Mythos creature is summoned. | A horde of Mythos creatures is summoned. |
| 8 | Foul mist spreads around you. | Something or someone dear to the caster is annihilated. |

## Investigation

### Social

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose **reaction** to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

| 2 | 3-5 | 6-8 | 9-11 | 12 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

When the PCs try to get a favor or information from an NPC, consider the following factors:

**Stakes**: do the PCs ask for a lot or just a small favor?\
**Motivation**: does the PC's proposition align with what the NPC wants?\
**Respect**: does the NPC personally respect the PCs based on their behavior and reputation?\
**Leverage**: do the PCs present anything that forces the NPC's hand?

Most social encounters can be resolved by critical thinking. Sometimes, however, the NPC's reaction is unclear. In this case, the Warden makes another reaction roll and applies a modifier between -4 and +4 to the result, based on the four factors. The NPC agrees if the result is 'kind' or 'helpful' (9+). If the result is 'curious' (6-8), the NPC can still be convinced considering the four factors, but if the result is 'wary' (3-5), it takes a lot more for the NPC to agree.

### Research

A PC can do research by talking to strangers in bars, studying books in a library or scouring through records in an archive. First, they need to state a question they want answered, or a topic they want to explore. Secondly, they require access to the information and must be able to understand the language.

When these conditions are met, the PC only needs time in order to get answers. The default scale used here is shifts (1 shift = 8 hours), but the Warden should adapt it to whatever makes sense in the scenario. The Warden announces the scale and rolls 2d6 in secret, or 1d6 if the PC is particularly knowledgeable in the field.

The PC declares how much time they want to spend, and if that is longer than or equal to the result of the roll, they get everything. Otherwise, they get *nothing or only some part* of what can be learned. They may then spend more time on research, but working through the night leaves PCs **deprived**.

**Deprived**: A PC deprived of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover HP and reset their Sanity.\
**Shift**: Lasts for 8 hours. PCs must rest for roughly one shift per day and can work for two shifts without any problems.\
**Turn**: Lasts for 10 minutes.

### Exploration

Consider three [kinds of information](https://diyanddragons.blogspot.com/2019/10/landmark-hidden-secret.html) (by Anne on diyanddragons.blogspot.com):

**Landmark** information is everything that is immediately visible when you enter a room. The Warden gives this kind of information to the players for *free*.\
**Hidden** information can only be learned if players specifically ask for it and directly interact with the fiction. It often comes at a cost: first, you probably have to spend some *time* to examine the object. Looking in the right place yields immediate results, but a general search of a room takes 1 turn (10 minutes). Second, you expose your PC to *risk* as you have to be close enough to touch the object you want to investigate.\
**Secret** information always comes at a cost and there is a *chance for failure*. In general, information should almost *never* be secret. If players interact with the fictional world, they will get answers.

Finding clues should not present a challenge to players, and there are no mechanics for exploration in Eldritch Instinct. Rather, it is a conversation between the players and the Warden: when describing a location, the Warden begins by setting the mood and presenting landmark information, which often functions as threads, that the players can pull for more information. The players may then ask questions and describe their PC’s actions in order to uncover hidden information. The Warden answers truthfully, but should make sure that characters receive information that is appropriate to their occupation. The Warden should encourage the players to state what they want to know and what their characters do to figure it out.

#### Noticing something

Although the Warden should not rely on it too much, it can be a great addition to reveal threads, little details or early warning signs after asking a single PC for a Luck save. It helps to raise the tension and reminds players that they might want to spend their Luck sparingly.

## Action

Combat, chases and stealth are extremely tense situations for both the PCs and the players. PCs are assumed to be generally able to defend themselves, run or stay hidden when required. Instead, the following rules focus on the critical moments that decide over life and death. Feel free to hack the rules and experiment with different procedures!

### Combat

#### Rounds

A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time. 

#### Surprise

If the PCs are surprised, they only get to act in the first round if they make a successful Luck save.

#### Actions

In one round, a character may move somewhere close (15 m) and take up to one action. This may be checking someone's vitals, attacking, reloading a gun, making a second move, or some other reasonable action.

#### Range

There are four range bands: **Adjacent**: less than 1 m. **Close**: less than 15 m. **Long** : less than 100 m. **Extreme**: more than 100 m.

#### Attacking & Damage

The attacker rolls their weapon damage and subtracts the target's armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP. If the attacker used a weapon with a magazine, they mark off the appropriate number of shots from their magazine.

#### Multiple shots from a pistol

If shooting two or three times with a pistol, roll damage for each shot and keep the single highest result.

#### Firearm Attack Modifiers

- Take Cover: If you are in cover and spend your action to take cover, enemies shooting at you roll with [-].
- Aiming: You can spend your turn aiming in order to roll with [+] on your shot in the next round.
- Diving for Cover: once per round as a reaction to being shot at, you may spend your action and make a SPE save. If you succeed, enemies roll with [-].
- Fast Moving: roll with [-] when you or your target is moving fast.

#### Blast

Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite.

#### Firing into melee

When an attacker shoots into a melee fight, they hit their *ally* if at least one of the damage dice shows a 1.

#### Dodge

A PC may avoid all melee attacks in one round if they spend their turn to dodge and make a successful SPE save. They may then spend their movement to retreat. If the opponent decides to pursue, proceed with a chase.

#### Round Order

At the start of each round, the Warden will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs or monsters, then the PCs declare what they are doing in response.

First, the Warden determines all PCs who are being attacked in *melee*. These PCs are in a **duel** with the monsters attacking them. In each duel, the player acts first, then the monsters. Duels where a PC attacks a monster in another duel are resolved last. Repeat this process for *ranged* duels, and finally resolve all remaining actions.

If a monster can attack more than once per round, all attacks after its first are resolved at the end of the round.

#### Example

*Lillian is being attacked by a cultist with a knife and will fight back. There is also a shadowy figure who will shoot their pistol at her. Robert is being attacked by a corrupt cop with a baton, but will attack the cultist. Ethel tries to shoot the shadowy figure with her rifle.*

1. *Lillian and Robert are in a melee duel, but Lillian's duel will be resolved first because Robert is attacking a monster in another duel.*

2. *Lillian is also in a ranged duel, but as she has already spent her action this round she does not react to the shadowy figure shooting at her.*

3. *Ethel's action is resolved last because she is not in a duel.*

### Chases

During a chase, the PCs have to overcome *three* critical obstacles which require a save each. Rolling a critical fail yields -1 point, a fail yields 0 points, a success yields 1 point and a critical success yields 2 points. A PC needs 1 point at the end of the chase in order to escape or catch their opponent.

#### Difficulty

If the chase is particularly easy or difficult, the PCs must roll with [-] or [+] on some of the saves. The Warden announces at the start of the chase how many [-] or [+] must be applied, but the players may choose which saves they want to roll with [-] or [+] as they come up.

| very hard | hard | normal | easy | very easy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 x [-] | [-] | / | [+] | 2 x [+] |

#### Approximate chances for failure

| Group size | very hard | hard | normal | easy | very easy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 PC | 47 % | 36 % | 27 % | 16 % | 9 % |
| 4 PCs, at least 1 fails | 92 % | 83 % | 72 % | 50 % | 31 % |

#### Helping others

If a PC has 3 or more points at the start of the third obstacle, they may help a slow PC. The result of their third save is added to the points of the slow PC. If the slow PC does not have at least 1 point at the end, both PCs are caught.

### Chase Obstacles

Ideally, the obstacles the PCs have to overcome should be what is in the path each PC chooses in the fictional world. This allows the players to split up and choose their own path, while giving the Warden opportunities to throw a spanner in the works. You can use the following table for inspiration.

| d20 | STR | d20 | SPE | d20 | INT |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Something is in the way (crates, furniture). | 8 | Get past something in time. | 15 | Find a place to hide. |
| 2 | You are being slowed down (thicket, people). | 9 | Get down a slope. | 16 | A deep puddle. |
| 3 | Climb a wall. | 10 | Run across open field. | 17 | Cross a busy road. |
| 4 | Jump across a gap. | 11 | A fallen tree. | 18 | Fog or darkness. |
| 5 | Climb stairs or ladder. | 12 | Sharp turn. | 19 | Find a shortcut. |
| 6 | Get over or through a fence. | 13 | Uneven ground (roots, stones). | 20 | Slippery ground (mud, ice, oil). |
| 7 | Cross a stream. | 14 | Someone drops something on the ground. | | |

### Stealth & Deception

If the PCs do not have to stay unnoticed or unrecognized for very long, it is sufficient to have everyone make a Luck save. PCs are exposed on a critical fail. For example: *hiding in the bushes waiting for the cultist to pass by.*

However, if the PCs' scheme is more complex, make a clock by drawing a circle and dividing it into a number of sections: 4 for moderate complexity like breaking into a house, or 6-8 for more complex ones. As time passes, or when the PCs are loud, fill in a section.

The Warden should throw in a few critical situations when the PCs quickly have to find a hiding spot or find an excuse for why they should be allowed to be there. They should usually require a save. Fill in another section on a fail, and two on a critical fail. A great device is to give PC choices. For example: *hiding under a desk has a 70 % chance of success, while hiding in a closet has a 90 % chance of success, but the PC must drop bulky items.*

## Downtime

In the background, players can do a number of things that advance their PCs, but are only summarized at the table. They could read tomes, spend time with their bonds, improve an aspect of their character, craft something, research a topic, travel somewhere, make new acquaintances, or earn money.

These are just some suggestions, and the Warden should determine the effects and the amount of time that must be spent. A good rule of thumb for the length of a downtime action is two weeks, but the Warden should adjust the time to their needs.

## Pulp

If your group decides to run a more action-oriented adventure, consider these changes:

- You can spend all Luck (min 30) to avoid certain death.
- Regain 1d6 Hit Protection for 20 Luck if you are not wounded.
- You have 25-100 % more Hit Protection.
- Avoid unconsciousness by spending 2 Luck per minute.
- When regenerating Luck, you regain 2d10+10 on a fail and 1d10+5 on a success.
- You may spend Luck to re-roll Fortitude saves.
- You regenerate 2 MP per hour.
- Magazines do to occupy inventory slots.

# Rules Summary

### Saves

Roll equal to or under ability score to avoid consequences. 91-99 is always a failure. Add 20 to your ability score when doing something related to your occupation. Doubles are Criticals (e.g. 00, 44).

### Luck

You may spend 5 Luck to re-roll an ability or resistance save, except when the result was a critical fail. After each session, make a Luck save and restore 1d10 Luck on a fail.

### Actions

On their turn, a character may move up to 15 m and take up to one action. Actions may include attacking, making a second move, or other reasonable activities.

Spend your action and make a successful SPE save to dodge all melee attacks for one round. **Retreating** from a dangerous situation always requires a successful SPE save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Inventory

PCs have 7 inventory slots: Most items take up a one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.

Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 7 slots) takes twice the amount of damage and makes SPE saves with [-]. PCs cannot carry more than their inventory allows.

### Healing

A moment's rest and a swig of water will restore lost HP for PCs who are not wounded. However, if you are wounded, make a CON save after every week. On a success, recover 1d4 HP. You heal a wound on a critical success, or when you recover to more than half of your maximum HP.
A PC deprived of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover HP and reset their Sanity.

### Combat

The attacker rolls damage and subtracts the target's Armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP.

At the start of each round, the Warden will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs or monsters, then the PCs declare what they are doing in response.

First, the Warden determines all PCs who are being attacked in melee. These PCs are in a **duel** with the monsters attacking them. In each duel, the player acts first, then the monsters. Duels where a PC attacks a monster in another duel are resolved last. Repeat this process for ranged duels, and finally resolve all remaining actions.

### Damage

If an attack takes a PC’s HP below half of the maximum, the PC is wounded and must roll on the wounds table, fall prone and make a CON save or fall unconscious. If you have 0 HP, fall unconscious and make a death save: roll 1d10 without looking at the result. As soon as someone spends a round to check your vitals, reveal the die and look up the result on the Death Table.

### Sanity Save

Roll 1d4. If the result is lower than your Sanity, you are unsettled and reduce your Sanity by 1. When your Sanity hits 1, make a Fortitude save and set your Sanity back to 2. After 8 hours of uninterrupted rest, reset your Sanity to 4.

### Fortitude Save

Make a WIL save: on a success, fill in a Hardened notch. Otherwise, fill in a Broken notch, lose 1d10 WIL and panic: **fight** until the stimulus is destroyed, **flee** until you are far away or **freeze** (hide from the it).

### Getting Better

There are a number of possibilities to remove Broken notches: Self-help, commitment to a sanatorium, covering traces and conversation with other PCs. Each time you get rid of one Broken notch, increase your WIL by 1d10.
