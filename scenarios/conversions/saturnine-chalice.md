# Saturnine Chalice
- Converted from the original work by [Alan Bligh, Matthew Sanderson, and friends (Chaosium)](https://www.chaosium.com/dead-light-and-other-dark-turns/)
- Conversion done by [Linus Weber](https://linuz.itch.io)

#### Evangeline Weyland
3 HP, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, claws (d6), INS 1/1d3

#### Shapeless One
n/a STR, 18 DEX, 18 WIL
- **Immune** to all physical attacks.
- **Steal Memories:** target loses d4 WIL per round until they make a WIL save.
- **Inflict Madness:** opposed WIL roll, target gains dX Insight points on failure.

#### Confronting the Shapeless One

- Character with highest WIL makes opposed WIL save against Shapeless One to banish it. Each attempt costs 1d20 MP and 1d4 Broken notches.

#### Notes

- Solving the puzzle with the patterns on magic squares is superfluous to solving the mystery or banishing the demon. I would either cut it to save time or make up something new like in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/callofcthulhu/comments/1g9w22y/saturnine_chalice_puzzle_rework/).
