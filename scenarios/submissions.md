# Submissions

## Originals

You are allowed and encouraged to publish your own scenarios and other products for Eldritch Instinct commercially or for free without my express permission. The Eldritch Instinct SRD is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0). Please do not use AI generated content such as images or text in your products.

Send me a message on Discord with a link where your product can be accessed and I'll be happy to include it in the list of original scenarios and in other collections.

## Compatibility Logo

You can use [this logo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CVwK67pTm_y7IEDsBzobNCj2qnV0GPqS/view?usp=sharing) to indicate that your scenario can be used with Eldritch Instinct.

## Eldritch Archives

The Eldritch Archives are a repository for community-created assets created for published scenarios and settings such as maps, handouts, soundfiles and guides. Send me a message on Discord with a link. The restrictions for original scenarios apply to assets and settings as well.

## Conversions

- Copy the following template when submitting an adventure to the Eldritch Instinct website.
- The file should be written in Markdown. The filename should be lowercase, and use the *.md suffix (example: cool-scenario.md).
- Make sure the add the "front matter" at the top of the file (the parts starting with the `---` at the beginning) or the submission won't work. For an example, see [here](/scenarios/conversions/roadhouse-feast/) (raw text [here](https://github.com/Linus4/eldritchinstinct/blob/main/scenarios/conversions/roadhouse-feast.md?plain=1)).
- Scenario submissions should _always_ credit the author of the work _as well_ as the name of the person converting the work. 
- Please link to the author, as well as the adventure and (if you're comfortable with it) your own website or contact. 
- If possible, ask for the author's permission. If not, that's OK! We don't generally need it, but it's great to have.
