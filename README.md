**Eldritch Instinct** is an adventure game for one facilitator (the **Warden**)
and at least one other player.
Players act as curious investigators of the strange and unexplained. They will
run from delusional cultists, hide from stalking shadows and face terrifying
monstrosities. And they will change - through encounters with the unnatural
forces of the Mythos and the limits of their own Humanity.
The game was written by Linus Weber.
