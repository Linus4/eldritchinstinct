**Eldritch Instinct** is an [adventure game](https://questingblog.com/adventure-game-vs-osr/) for one  Warden and one or more players who act as investigators of the strange and unexplained. As a player, you will take on delusional cultists, hide from stalking shadows and face terrifying monstrosities.

Brace yourself for a blend of cosmic horror and adrenaline-pumping action in which _you_ do the investigating, not your character. Hunt down forbidden knowledge in your quest to foil the sinister Mythos agenda.
