In **Eldritch Instinct**, players act as curious investigators of the strange
and unexplained. They will run from delusional cultists, hide from stalking
shadows and face terrifying monstrosities. And they will change - through
encounters with the unnatural forces of the Mythos and the limits of their own
Humanity. The game was designed to run longer Call of Cthulhu scenarios and
campaigns using streamlined rules with great mechanics adapted from all kinds
of roleplaying games while following the axioms of the old school style as
described by Ben Milton, Steven Lumpkin and David Perry in the Principia
Apocrypha. Written by Linus Weber.
