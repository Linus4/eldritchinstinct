In **Eldritch Instinct**, players act as curious investigators of the strange
and unexplained. They will run from delusional cultists, hide from stalking
shadows and face terrifying monstrosities. And they will change - through
encounters with the unnatural forces of the Mythos and the limits of their own
Humanity. The game was designed to run low-pulp scenarios and campaigns
while following the axioms described by Ben Milton, Steven Lumpkin and David Perry 
in the Principia Apocrypha. Written by Linus Weber.
