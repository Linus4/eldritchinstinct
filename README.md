**Eldritch Instinct** is an [adventure game](https://questingblog.com/adventure-game-vs-osr/) written by Linus Weber for one Warden and one or more players who act as investigators of the strange and unexplained. As a player, you will take on delusional cultists, hide from stalking shadows and face terrifying monstrosities.

Brace yourself for a blend of cosmic horror and adrenaline-pumping action in which _you_ do the investigating, not your character. Hunt down forbidden knowledge in your quest to foil the sinister Mythos agenda.

Eldritch Instinct features:
- Procedures, tables and advice refined over three years of playtesting to facilitate _immersive_ and _suspenseful_ horror scenarios.
- Quick character generation with several random tables that includes meaningful relationships with other characters.
- 40 pages in A5 spread layout for convenient reference at the table.
- Free introductory scenario "Roadhouse Feast" (available separately).
- Character sheet by [Francesco Zanieri / Licopeoart](https://www.instagram.com/licopeoart/).
- Copyediting by [Tim B. / congas.blog](https://congas.blog/).
