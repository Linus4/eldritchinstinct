# Fast Insight

Author: [Linus Weber](https://linuz.itch.io/)

This is Work-In-Progress and will have to be playtested in a full campaign, but I've received positive feedback in one-shots. If this system works well, it might make it into the game as the default some day.

## Why

- I want to speed up those tense moments by reducing the amount of rolls needed when panicking (currently 5, down to 3: ~~Insight Save~~, Insight Amount, Panic Save, ~~Panic Rounds~~, Recover WIL Save) and generally when gaining Insight (currently 2, down to 1: ~~Insight Save~~, Insight Amount).
- I want there to be a bit more panicking in general.
- I want there to be more chances of panicking when seeing moderately bad things. Previously, characters gained 1/1d4 in those cases, but now they gain 2 Insight Dice which could be 5 or 6 Insight, albeit not very likely.
- I want characters to change more through gaining Broken and Hardened notches which means that charcters must panic more often.
- I want to simplify the INS stat.

## Insight

- Characters start with 0 Hardened notches. Find a character sheet with 0 Hardened notches in the [game files](https://eldritchinstinct.com/game-files/).
- No more Insight Saves.
- No more rolls to determine amount of rounds panicing.
- New Insight Dice: d6 and discard 4+ results on each die. Gain that amount of Insight points.
- Still: Panic save when you gain 5+ Insight at once or cannot cross out enough pips.
- Roll 1 Insight Die for something Unsettling such as traces of the horror. Roll 2 Insight Dice for something Awful such as a mangled corpse. Roll 3 Insight Dice for something Dreadful such as seeing a monster.
- Note: Plan with ~8-12 Insight Dice per scenario.

## Panic

- WIL save after 1 round of panicing: success -> calm down and gain Hardened notch; fail -> gain Broken notch and panic for one more round.
- New: After your WIL save after recovering from a panic, you may convert 4 Insight points into 1 Broken notch.

## Getting better

- On a failed self help attempt, lose the bond and keep the Broken notch, but gain a Hardened notch. (Lose a bond every third Hardened notch you gain!)

## Open Questions

- Does this lead to too much panicking?
- Is panicking too punishing, just right or not punishing enough?
