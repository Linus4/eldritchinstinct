# C.A.T.S. Example

_Adjust to fit your needs._

**Concept:** _Eldritch Instinct_ is an adventure game that blends cosmic horror with pulp action. You slip into the roles of everyday people who come face to face with the unspeakable horrors of the Mythos. You investigate mysteries by describing your actions in the game world, not by interacting with game mechanics; in other words, _you_ do the investigating, not your character!
    
**Aim:** As a player, your goal is to survive the scenario and find out what's really going on. Your actions should be influenced by who your character is, but at the same time, you should push your character to new extremes. The fun is in finding out what happens to your characters and how your decisions affect the world.

**Tone:** This scenario deals with some serious themes. It lends itself to an immersive and tense atmosphere, and it can be a bit over the top and larger than life. Some comic relief outside of the game is appreciated, but your Investigators should take the situation seriously.

**Subject Matter:** This scenario features theme1, theme2 and theme3. At any time during the game, you can ask me and the rest of the group to roll back certain events or avoid certain subject matter going forward. Is there anything we should definitely avoid in our game, or are there certain themes we should treat with some discretion?
