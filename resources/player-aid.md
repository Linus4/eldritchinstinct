A PDF version is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pDlzchB6JxCpiyCWfIY1naYfXx8l-sdH/view?usp=sharing).

## Principles for Players

### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items or skills you have.
- Take the Warden's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.

### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people. When you're asking for a favor, consider the stakes, their goals, your reputation and your leverage over them.
- NPCs donâ€™t always tell the whole truth. Your Warden should give hints, but who you do and do not trust is ultimately your decision.

### Atmosphere
- Prepare to die; combat is extremely quick and violent. Make your last moments count and revel in your investigator's tragic demise.
- Use your investigator's occupation to inform the way you approach situations and describe your investigator's actions.

### Planning
- Think of ways to avoid obstacles and stack the odds in your favor through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Keep notes to help you remember details from your investigation.

### Agency
- Don't ask only what your investigator would do; ask what _you_ would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

## Player-facing Rules

### Healing

Restore lost HP by resting for a few minutes and rolling the Agenda Die (d6).

Restore lost attribute points over a couple weeks' rest.

### Magic Points

Regenerate 1 MP per hour.

### Mythos Knowledge

Spend 5 MK to re-roll a damage roll or save (unless it is a critical fail).

Turn 2d6 Insight points into MK once per scenario through sleep and writing a journal entry.

Gain additional MK by studying tomes between scenarios.

### Inventory

Carrying a full inventory (9 slots) or something Very Heavy like an injured investigator reduces your HP to 0 and slows you down during chases.

### Actions

On your turn in combat, you may move up to 15 meters and take one action. Each side's actions are resolved simultaneously.

### Critical Damage

Stabilize an injured character by giving them aid (such as bandages). Roll a d100 on the Wounds Table to determine what happens to them.

### Combat

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

Impaired attacks deal d4 damage and Enhanced attacks deal d12.

Massive opponents take d4 damage from all attacks unless they deal Blast damage.

### Broken or Hardened

After panicking, make a WIL save to determine whether you gain a Hardened or a Broken notch.

### Getting Better

Remove Broken notches through self-help, committing yourself to a sanatorium or by covering traces of the Mythos.

### Spellcasting

The first time you cast each spell, make a WIL save. On a fail, all costs are multiplied by d4 and you roll on the Miscast Table.
