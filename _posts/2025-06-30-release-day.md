Today marks the day that I finally have all the pieces together to publish Eldritch Instinct!

I believe that Eldritch Instinct brings something new to the genre of Cosmic Horror roleplaying: a playstyle that revolves around decision making, player skill and creative problem solving.

With this ruleset and the accompanying scenario 'Roadhouse Feast', I want to share advice and best practices I've picked up over the years that should help you run immersive and suspenseful horror scenarios in a way that is accessible to everyone, and new Wardens in particular.

Contrary to traditional roleplaying games, Eldritch Instinct doesn't ask "Can your investigator do this?" or "Does your investigator know this?". You're all playing capable investigators, each with their own area of expertise. Instead, Eldritch Instinct asks "How long does this take you?" or "Can you avoid consequences doing this?".

Another goal of mine is to showcase how Warden-friendly roleplaying books can be: I want to run scenarios without a ton of prep-work straight from the book!

Third, I want to build a platform and an open and creative community following Yochai Gal's example ([Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/) / [NSR](https://newschoolrevolution.com/)). I'm sure that there are many cool and weird scenarios to be written with a focus on challenging the *players*, rather than their characters.

We'll see where it goes from here. Happy gaming!

> Eldritch Instinct is now available on [itch.io](https://linuz.itch.io/) and [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/526831/eldritch-instinct).
